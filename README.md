Application Frameworks
======================

This project contains two frameworks, one for application development using Qt 5 and one for 3D visualization using OpenGL. These two frameworks are created as standalone libraries, but they also work perfectly together.

## Dependencies
The requirements for using these libraries are CMake and Qt 5.

## Related projects
These libraries are used by [ResInsight](https://github.com/OPM/ResInsight) and some other smaller projects.
